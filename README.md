# Number-Guesssing-Game
This game is a **Number Guessing Game** built with SwiftUI, where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game tracks attempts, allowing up to 10 guesses to find the correct number. Each guess updates the feedback message to guide the player: if the guess is too low, the message will prompt them to guess higher; if it's too high, the prompt advises lower. Successful guesses show a celebratory message and end the game. Players can reset the game with a "Play Again" button for a fresh start, and feedback text changes color based on how close the player's guess is to the target number, adding a visually engaging hint to their progress.
